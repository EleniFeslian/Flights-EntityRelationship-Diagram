# Flights-EntityRelationship-Diagram
The project involves designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram to model the database schema for the airline flights and reservations system. The key entities identified are Flights, Airports, Airplanes and Reservations, each with appropriate attributes such as flight numbers, departure/arrival times, airport codes ans anything else that may be of need. Relationships are established to represent real-world interactions: Passengers make Reservations, Reservations correspond to specific Flights, and Flights operate between Airports. Cardinalities are defined to clarify the nature of these relationships, such as many-to-many for Passengers and Flights. Constraints like primary and foreign keys ensure data integrity, while optional entities like Crew Members or Ticket Classes add depth to the schema. The design provides a clear and normalized representation of the airline system, ready for database implementation.
